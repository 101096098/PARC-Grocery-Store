        <h2>Information about the PARC Grocery Store</h2>
        <p class="auto-style9">What started as a humble idea to bring affordable, healthy food to people evolved into our idea for an online grocery store that 
            also delivers food right to your door.</p>
        <p class="auto-style9">&nbsp;Realizing that many people are too busy to go shopping, suffer from a variety of disabilities 
            which may make shopping difficult or may simple enjoy the ease of having groceries delivered to their house, we sought to create an easy
            to navigate website which would allow people to buy food easily and affordably.
            </p>
        <p class="auto-style9">Here at PARC Grocery we believe the most important aspect of a website is making the user experience as pleasurable as possible. 
        </p>
        <p class="auto-style9">Our website is designed to make navigation a breeze and our simple layout allows users to easily create accounts, navigate our catalogue of items and purchase them.
